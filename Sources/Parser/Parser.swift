/// The Parser is used to recognize language syntax that has been specified in the form of a context free grammar.
///
/// When parsing an expression, an underlying stack and the current input token determine what happens
/// next. If the next token looks like part of a valid grammar rule (based on other items on the stack), it is
/// generally shifted onto the stack. If the top of the stack contains a valid right-hand-side of a grammar rule,
/// it is usually “reduced” and the symbols replaced with the symbol on the left-hand-side. When this reduction occurs,
/// the appropriate action is triggered (if defined).
///
/// ### LR Parser Algorithm

///   push initial state s0
///   token = scan()
///   do forever
///     t = top-of-stack (state) symbol
///     switch action[t, token] {
///
///        # A shift action means to push the current token onto the stack.
///        # In fact, we actually push a state symbol onto the stack. Each
///        # "shift" action in the action table includes the state to be pushed.
///        case shift s:
///            push(s)
///            token = scan()
///
///        # When we reduce using the grammar rule A → alpha, we pop alpha off
///        # of the stack. If alpha contains N symbols, we pop N
///        # states off of the stack. We then use the goto table to know what to push:
///        # the goto table is indexed by state symbol t and nonterminal A, where t
///        # is the state symbol that is on top of the stack after popping N times.
///        case reduce by A → alpha:
///            for i = 1 to length(alpha) do pop() end
